***Blocklib.py Library
** Introduction
This library implements a simple blockchain in Python, allowing for user registration, transactions, and smart contracts. The library is designed to be easily extensible and adaptable for various applications.

** Key Features
Creation and management of a blockchain.
Addition of transactions between users.
Registration of new users.
Management of goods and trade.
Smart contracts for balance verification.
Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download Python from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copia codice
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies, if any:

bash
Copia codice
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Importing the Library
You can import the library in your Python project as follows:

python
Copia codice
from blockchain import Blockchain
Creating a New Blockchain
To create a new instance of the blockchain:

python
Copia codice
blockchain = Blockchain()
Registering a New User
To register a new user:

python
Copia codice
user_id = blockchain.register_user("Username")
print("User registered with ID:", user_id)
Adding a Transaction
To add a new transaction between two users:

python
Copia codice
next_index = blockchain.add_transaction(sender=user_id1, receiver=user_id2, amount=10)
print("Transaction added to block:", next_index)
Checking User Balance
To get the balance of a user:

python
Copia codice
balance = blockchain.get_balance(user_id)
print("User balance:", balance)
Listing Goods for Sale
To add goods for sale:

python
Copia codice
blockchain.list_good_for_sale(user_id, "GoodName", 50)
Buying a Good
To purchase a good from another user:

python
Copia codice
success = blockchain.buy_good(buyer_id, seller_id, "GoodName")
if success:
    print("Purchase completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Purchase failed.")
Validating the Blockchain
To check if the blockchain is valid:

python
Copia codice
is_valid = blockchain.chain_valid(blockchain.chain)
if is_valid:
    print("The blockchain is valid.")
else:
    print("The blockchain is not valid.")
Smart Contracts Functionality
The smart_contract function checks if the sender has enough balance to make a transaction:

python
Copia codice
if blockchain.smart_contract(blockchain, sender_id, receiver_id, amount):
    print("Smart contract: sufficient balance.")
else:
    print("Smart contract: insufficient balance.")
